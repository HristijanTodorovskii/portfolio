                <p class="p-content mb-4">Being always curious and passionate about design, I enrolled to the UX/UI Academy , which felt like a natural next step in my career. And as always, trusting my gut payed off, and I found myself glued to the computer working and creating.
                </p>
                <p class="p-content mb-4">With my previous experiences as a product manager,  I became very detail oriented , responsible, committed to a project with a get-it-done attitude.

                            Julija was among the best students that I had the opportunity to teach, she is a great listener and she understands <br> complex issues and new information very quickly. She was one of very few students that understood and started to <br> adopt the agile mindset and her design thinking skills are also very good. Based on her activity and engagement on <br> the classes, tasks and projects I believe she shows great potential and will be a valuable and highly skilled UX <br> Designer. She has great communication skills in addition to a balanced set of soft and hard skills and a very <br> positive personality.</p>
